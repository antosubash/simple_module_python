## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- Vite's dev-mode dependency pre-bundling now resolves cross-package bare
  imports (e.g. `maplibre-gl`, `pmtiles`) from module pages whose importers sit
  outside the host's `client_app/` — including wheel-installed modules and
  workspace modules shipping their own JS deps. The scaffold template (Vite 6)
  seeds `optimizeDeps.esbuildOptions.nodePaths` and the framework repo (Vite 8)
  seeds `optimizeDeps.rolldownOptions.resolve.modules` with the workspace
  `node_modules/` as a NODE_PATH-style fallback for the dep scanner (GH issue #152).
- The `moduleBareImportResolver` Vite plugin no longer short-circuits on
  `fsRoot`/`projectRoot` containment, so workspace-member modules at
  `modules/<name>/<pkg>/pages/` get the same workspace-root re-resolution as
  wheel-installed modules. In an npm-workspaces layout the workspace root *is*
  the resolver root, so the previous early-return excluded the very modules
  that need it. Cross-package bare imports (`maplibre-gl`, `pmtiles`, peer
  deps) now resolve in both wheel and workspace install modes (GH issue #156).
- The `users` module's post-login redirect (`login_redirect_url`) no longer
  hard-codes a `/` fallback when the Dashboard module isn't installed — `/`
  404s on apps without a root route (e.g. `smpy_gis`, `--preset minimal`). It
  now redirects to the first sibling module that exposes view routes, falling
  back to `/` only as an absolute last resort. Operator-set overrides are
  always preserved (GH issue #173).
